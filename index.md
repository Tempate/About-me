# About me

I am a 25-year-old mathematics student from Madrid. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki. My main interests are Set Theory, Algebraic Topology, and Machine Learning. I have set up this website to compile my most presentable work.
