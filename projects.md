Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on over the years.

- **Ataxx [Engine](https://github.com/Tempate/Funes) and [Server](https://github.com/Tempate/litaxx)**
  * September 2019 – October 2020  
  * I built a C++ engine for the game *Ataxx* that was among the strongest engines at the time. I also built a server to play the game online.

- **Chess [Engine](https://github.com/Tempate/Achillees)**
  * June 2019 – October 2019  
  * I built a chess engine in C using alpha-beta pruning. In the 40/15 [CCRL ranking](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/engine_details.cgi?print=Details&each_game=0&eng=Achillees%201.0%2064-bit#Achillees_1_0_64-bit), it reached #290 with 2250 ELO.

- **8-bit [Computer](https://github.com/Tempate/8-bit)**
  * December 2017 – March 2018  
  * I built an 8-bit computer based on [Ben Eater’s series](https://youtu.be/HyznrdDSSGM?feature=shared) and designed schematics for each component.

- **Personal [Website](https://github.com/Tempate/Personal-Website)**
  * September 2016 – June 2018  
  * I built a [website](https://danidiaz.onrender.com/) to implement classic algorithms.

- **Paper Fight & Skilly** 
  * September 2014 – December 2015  
  * I built two iOS games — *Paper Fight* and *Skilly* — in Swift. Together they reached over 10,000 downloads on the App Store.
